# Callback Options

Along with relevant data per callback, all callback functions receive a single object that includes 3 common values:

1. `instance` - the datepicker instance. This is mostly just for convenience.
2. `trigger` - the source of what triggered the callback. This can be imperative methods, such as `selectDate` and `show` or user interactions with the DOM, such as `click`.
3. `triggerType` - the category of what triggered the callback - `user` or `imperative`.
<!-- TODO - list out all possible values for trigger. -->

`trigger` and `triggerType` give you the ability to have finer control over your callback logic. These values let you filter for specific scenarios if you want. Example

```typescript
onSelect({prevDate, nextDate, trigger, triggerType}) {
  // Ignore any events that were generated by imperative methods.
  if (triggerType === 'imperative') return

  if (trigger === 'setMin') {
    // Only respond to when the `setMin` method is called.
  }

  // Do other stuff here...
}
```

## onSelect

Callback function after a date has been selected. It will receive the previous and newly selected dates. If `newDate` is `undefined`, that means the calendar date has been de-selected.

```typescript
onSelect({
  prevDate: Date | undefined
  newDate: Date | undefined

  // Common arguments.
  instance: DatepickerInstance
  trigger: Trigger
  triggerType: TriggerType
}): void
```

**Default value:** `undefined`

**Example**:

```typescript
const picker = datepicker(selector, {
  onSelect({prevDate, nextDate, instance, trigger, triggerType}) {
    if (!nextDate) {
      // The date is being deselected.
    }

    if (nextDate) {
      // The date is being selected.
    }
  },
})
```
