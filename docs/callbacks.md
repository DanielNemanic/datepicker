# Callback Options

All callback options will receive 2 common arguments:

1. The datepicker instance. This is mostly just for convenience.
2. `isImperative`
   - `true` - the callback was triggered by imperative methods, such as `.show()`, `.selectDate(...)`, etc.
   - `false` - the callback was triggered by user interaction with the DOM, such as clicking a date, clicking the next-month arrow, etc.

`isImperative` gives you the ability to have finer control over your callback logic. This boolean lets you "filter" for only user interaction with the DOM or not. For example:

```typescript
onSelect({prevDate, nextDate, isImperative}) {
  // Ignore any events that were generated by imperative methods.
  if (isImperative) return

  // Do stuff here...
}
```

## onSelect

Callback function after a date has been selected. It will receive the previous and newly selected dates. If `newDate` is `undefined`, that means the calendar date has been de-selected.

```typescript
onSelect({
  prevDate: Date | undefined
  newDate: Date | undefined

  // Common arguments.
  instance: DatepickerInstance
  isImeparative: boolean
}): void
```

**Default value:** `undefined`

**Example**:

```typescript
const picker = datepicker(selector, {
  onSelect({prevDate, nextDate, isImperative, instance}) {
    if (!nextDate) {
      // The date is being deselected.
    }

    if (nextDate) {
      // The date is being selected.
    }
  },
})
```
